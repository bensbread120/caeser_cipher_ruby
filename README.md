This is my solution to the caeser cipher basic ruby challenge for the Odin Project

I have used simple strings for the alphabet and both ternary operators and if/else statements for flow control

You'll notice the recursive function absolute_index() that loops over the index value until within the appropriate range for calling on the alphabet strings. I could have used a while loop here but wanted to get a bit of practice using recursive function, I think it has turned out pretty well.
